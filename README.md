# Stepper-motor-control
This repository contains code that I have written while learning how to control unipolar and bipolar stepper motors. My goal was to understand the fundamental workings of stepper motors. Therefore, I will not be using any libraries for programming the microcontroller; instead, I have written functions to set the pin states that control the MOSFETs connected to the internal coils of the stepper motors. I am using an Arduino and an L298N motor driver for the MOSFETs.
I will start with a brief overview: stepper motors are a kind of actuator used in many applications because of its high torque and ability to work in an open loop control system, this reduces the complexity of circuit needed to drive stepper motors. Driving stepper motors is also very simple compared. A stepper motor has to main parts a stator and a rotor. Based on the rotor, there are three types of stepper motors: permanent magnet motors, variable reluctance motor and hybrid synchronous motors. The motor I use is a permanent magnent rotor motor, which is the simplest among the three, but limits the number of steps the motor can have therefore the resolution of the motor. Focusing on the on the on the stator motors be further classified based on the 2 other factors, first we have the number of independent coils in the stator, this determines the phase of the motor, A motor with two independent phases is a 2 phase motor, a motor with 3 independent coils is a 3 phrase motor and so on. Secondly, based on the direction of current in the coils, a motor can either be unipolar or bipolar. A unipolar motor has current always flowing in the same direction in a coil, this is possible because of a center tap in the, where current is always suoolied through, based on which end of the coil is treated as the drain current flows into that direction. A bipolar motor on the other has no center tap and the magnetic flux is reversed simply by changing the polarity at the ends of the poles therfore changing the direction of current flow in the coils.
