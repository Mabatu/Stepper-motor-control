# Stepper-motor-control
This repository contains code that I have written while learning how to control unipolar and bipolar stepper motors. My goal was to understand the fundamental workings of stepper motors. Therefore, I will not be using any libraries for programming the microcontroller; instead, I have written functions to set the pin states that control the MOSFETs connected to the internal coils of the stepper motors. I am using an Arduino and an L298N motor driver for the MOSFETs.
I will begin with a brief overview of stepper motors. These actuators are used in a variety of applications due to their high torque and ability to operate in an open-loop control system, which simplifies the circuitry required to drive them. Compared to other types of motors, driving stepper motors is quite straightforward. 

A stepper motor consists of two main parts: a stator and a rotor. There are three types of stepper motors based on the rotor: permanent magnet motors, variable reluctance motors, and hybrid synchronous motors. The motor I am using is a permanent magnet rotor motor, which is the simplest of the three. However, this simplicity limits the number of steps the motor can take, thus affecting its resolution.

Focusing on the stator, stepper motors can be further classified based on two factors. First, we have the number of independent coils in the stator, which determines the motor's phase. A motor with two independent coils is a 2-phase motor, while a motor with three independent coils is a 3-phase motor, and so on. 

Secondly, motors can be categorized based on the direction of current in the coils, leading to two types: unipolar and bipolar motors. A unipolar motor has current flowing in the same direction within a coil, which is possible due to a center tap where the current is continuously supplied. Depending on which end of the coil is used as the drain, the current flows in that direction. In contrast, a bipolar motor does not have a center tap. Instead, the magnetic flux is reversed by changing the polarity at the ends of the coils, which changes the direction of current flow.
